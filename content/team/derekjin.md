Derek is a US Chess Federation National Master and has won many regional and national chess awards. He won the 10th place in the 2023 National Grade Championship. In the 2023 World Amateur Team East Tournament, his team won the 1st place of all the scholastic teams (K-12) and the 1st place of all the Massachusetts teams (all ages). He won the 3rd place in the 2023 Invitational Spiegel Cup State Championship (high school section), 2nd Place in the 2021 Invitational Spiegel Cup State Championship (high school section), and 2nd Place in the 2020 Invitation Spiegel Cup State Championship (14 and under). In the 2019 World Amateur East Team Tournament, his team won the Benjamin Award for securing the 1st place of all the Massachusetts teams (all ages). He was selected as a member of the 2018 All American Chess Team.

Derek has been co-organizing chess events and teaching free chess lessons for many years as the co-president and a founding board member of Chess4Unity (online, national) and president and co-founder of Chess+Math Lab (in person, local underserved communities). In addition, Derek enjoyed exploring number theory problems at the PROMYS math camp. He qualified for AIME in 2020-2024 and for AMO in 2024. One of Derekâ€™s greatest joys is to fuse math into fun chess activities and observe his students grow academic and life skills through chess games. Besides chess and math, Derek is on his school tennis varsity team and has a passion for writing.
