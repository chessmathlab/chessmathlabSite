## Chess + Math = Empower Mind
<br/> <br/>

### Chess & STEM For Kids
<br/>

<div class="row align-items-center">
<div class="col-md-12">     
<p>Our team is dedicated to nurturing intelligence and mental resilience in children through the game of chess. While not professional coaches, 
our volunteers bring passion and expertise to each session, emphasizing the mastery of chess strategies alongside the development of 
critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, we integrate Math and STEM-related subjects into our lessons,
utilizing chess games as a platform for learning. Children are encouraged to apply their chess knowledge and pattern recognition skills 
to Math and STEM concepts, fostering a deeper understanding of these subjects in a fun and interactive way. Through interactive lessons and gameplay,
our mentors guide children to think strategically and persevere through challenges,
both on and off the chessboard. By honing their skills in chess and applying them to Math and STEM subjects, children also sharpen their abilities 
in academics, career, and life. The transformative power of chess has the potential to unlock children's full capabilities, paving the way for a brighter future.</p>

<p>National Master Eric Feng teaches a group of young kids to play chess after they work with math problems. The kids learn the basic chess principles, ideas, and many tricks to use against their opponents! All the kids greatly enjoy playing the game, discussing the many different moves that are possible with each other as they play. Chess acts as a stress-reliever or a game to be played with friends when the time is right, as it gave these kids an extremely fun time! </p>

<p>At ChessMathLab, our commitment to fostering intellectual growth extends beyond children to seniors as well. 
Our dedicated volunteers organize special events at senior community centers, offering seniors the opportunity to learn
chess or enhance their skills. Engaging in chess not only keeps their minds sharp but also contributes to improved mental health by 
stimulating cognitive functions and promoting social interaction. Our volunteers provide patient guidance and support,
ensuring that seniors feel empowered and encouraged on their chess journey. Through these initiatives, ChessMathLab aims to enrich the lives of seniors,
providing them with a fulfilling activity that brings both mental stimulation and social connection.</p>

<p>National Master Derek Jin enjoyed teaching chess while waiting for his pizza to be ready. Playing chess can be a real simple pleasure! It is not only a great venue to meet people of all backgrounds, but also a wonderful tool to fight Alzheimerâ€™s and other cognitive diseases associated with aging. 91-year old Ziyun Wang (right) enjoys a super active life, playing chess and table tennis almost every day.</p>
