### About Event

On Feb 4, 2024, our team member, Eric Feng hosted an exhilarating chess free play event during the Lunar New Year celebration (a week ahead) organized by Acton Chinese Languange School!

At this special occasion, he set up two chess boards, inviting kids of all ages to challenge him in friendly matches. More than 20 enthusiastic children had played him, engaging in thrilling games of various formats, including 5-minute blitz, 3-minute blitz, and 1-minute bullet games.
As the chessboards come alive with strategic maneuvers and quick thinking, laughter and excitement fill the air.  All they experienced the thrill of competing against a chess master player, they celebrated the Lunar New Year with chess, fun, and friendly competition.
