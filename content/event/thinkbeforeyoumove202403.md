Far more than just recreation, chess rigorously enhances mathematical and strategic planning skills as well as creativity, focus, and sportsmanship. Despite the recent chess boom—with millions of online games played daily—the chess world remains a predominantly affluent, white/Asian/male community. The pandemic has also severely widened the education gap between Boston students, especially along the urban/suburban divide. 


To empower underserved populations, Chess+Math Lab has started at Sportsmen's Tennis and Enrichment Club (Sportsmen's) a monthly “Think Before You Move” initiative to teach chess and math to underserved youths in inner-city Boston. It is synergistic with Sportsmen’s nationally award winning signature community outreach program, Volley Against Violence, in partnership with Boston Police Department. Think Before You Move is offered monthly on Friday 5:30pm to 6pm (before the 6pm-8pm Volley Against Violence at Sportsmen's). 

As the first indoor African-American non-profit tennis club in the country, Sportsmen’s has supported, since 1961, Boston’s most vulnerable youths with free/low-cost tennis, academic, and life skill education.

Think Before You Move: 5:30-6pm Fridays at Sportsmen's Tennis and Enrichment Club: 950 Blue Hill Avenue, Dorchester Center, MA 02124
