[Cambridge Foundry Festival](https://www.cambridgefoundry.org/events/festival) is a weeklong festival, which intends to bridge generational gaps and foster connections between communities. Three of our team members hosted a two-hour chess event on Feb 24, 2024, the event attracted more than 30 festival participants (kids and adults) to play and learn chess with our team members. The participants really enjoyed the event.
