We’re excited to share that our team hosted a chess event at the [Cambridge Foundry Festival](https://www.cambridgefoundry.org/events/festival) for the second year in a row! This vibrant weeklong festival aims to bridge generational gaps and foster connections within the community.

On February 20, 2025, three of our team members led a two-hour chess session, welcoming more than 30 participants—both kids and adults—to play, learn, and explore the game with us. Seeing returning players from last year and meeting new chess enthusiasts made this event truly special. We’re grateful for the opportunity to share our love for chess and look forward to continuing our engagement in the community!
