On July 14, 2024, our team member, Eric Feng, hosted a chess learning event for seniors at the Little Senior Apartments on Mill Pond Rd in Little, MA.

The event saw the participation of 12 senior residents, ranging in age from 71 to 92. Two participants had played chess many years ago, while some others were familiar with Chinese chess. The event lasted about 1.5 hours, during which Eric explained the rules of chess piece movement, the concept of checkmate, basic tactics, and fundamental opening principles.

Eric also played two demonstration games with the two participants who had previous chess experience. Remarkably, each game lasted more than 20 moves. Both participants expressed their enjoyment and mentioned that they felt inspired to resume playing chess after not playing it for the past 20 years.

The other attendees also found the event enjoyable, and some expressed interest in learning chess.
